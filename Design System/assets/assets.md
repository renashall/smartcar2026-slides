# Design System assets

A catalog of every visual asset in `Design System/assets/`, grouped by folder, with one sentence on what each asset looks like and when to use it on a lesson slide. Assets are PNGs (transparent where useful) except the Rubik fonts.

Icon variant conventions: most base icons (e.g. `success.png`) ship with a matching `-light` recolor (e.g. `success-light.png`) — the same glyph tinted light/white for placement on dark or navy backgrounds. A handful of icons instead come as `-black` / `-white` pairs (the dark glyph for light backgrounds, the white glyph for dark backgrounds). You only need to picture one of each pair; the variant is the same shape recolored.
