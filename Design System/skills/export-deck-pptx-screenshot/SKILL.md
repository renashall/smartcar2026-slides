description: Export a rendered HTML slide deck to a 16:9 PPTX where each slide is a pixel-perfect screenshot image, with the deck's speaker notes and clickable link hotspots preserved. Use when asked to export an .html slide deck (e.g. an AI Code Academy lesson deck) to PowerPoint/.pptx and exact visual fidelity matters more than editable text.

# Export deck → PPTX (screenshot)

Build a PowerPoint where every slide is a full-bleed render of the HTML slide —
visuals are exact, with speaker notes and clickable links carried over.

## When to use

- The user asks to export, save, or "make a PowerPoint / .pptx" of a slide deck.
- Visual fidelity matters more than editing individual text boxes.

## How it works

1. Renders the deck to a clean PDF — reusing a sibling `lesson-<n>.pdf` if the
   `export-deck-pdf` skill already made one, otherwise a throwaway PDF.
2. Rasterizes each PDF page at 2x to a full-bleed image and places it on a
   13.333x7.5in (16:9) slide.
3. Attaches the deck's hidden `<script id="speaker-notes">` entries as PowerPoint
   notes (one per slide).
4. Adds a transparent, clickable hyperlink hotspot over each `<a href>`,
   positioned from the PDF's own link rect (PDF points map 1:1 to slide points),
   so the links work in PowerPoint too.

## Steps

1. Ensure the deps are in the active virtualenv:
   ```
   python -c "import pptx, fitz" || pip install python-pptx pymupdf
   ```
2. Run the bundled script with the deck HTML path:
   ```
   python <this-skill-folder>/build_pptx.py <path/to/lesson-<n>.html>
   ```
   It writes `lesson-<n>.pptx` next to the HTML (pass a second arg to override).
3. Keep it in the deck folder `content/slide-decks/lesson-<n>-<name>/` as
   `lesson-<n>.pptx` (see the `slide-deck-design` skill).

## Notes / trade-offs

- Slide text is a rendered **image**, not editable text boxes — this is the
  fidelity-vs-editability trade-off. Links and speaker notes are still preserved.
- A fully editable-text PPTX would need a different HTML→shapes exporter; this
  skill deliberately prioritizes exact visuals.
- The PDF step needs a Chromium-based browser (see `export-deck-pdf`); set the
  `DECK_BROWSER` env var to override auto-detection. Run `export-deck-pdf` first
  if you also want the standalone PDF kept beside the deck (it will be reused).
